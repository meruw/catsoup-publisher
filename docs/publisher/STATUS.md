# Publisher status

## Available

- Windows x64 desktop workspace with ES/EN playback, custom window controls, an episode catalog and local SQLite drafts.
- Accounts manages destinations per language. Settings manages shared developer credentials and optional HTTPS callback hosting for Instagram.
- Console at the foot of the sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D) opens a dark, collapsible diagnostic panel with clipboard search, source/context/level filters, attempt tracking and JSONL export. Pause and active-filter indicators remain visible when folded. Reset filters restores the unfiltered view; Clear view hides existing events without deleting logs, and Show saved history restores them. It can expand below the window bar; collapsing preserves filters and suspends live UI updates. Local slog/Lumberjack logs rotate at 10 MB with five backups and seven-day retention. Credentials and provider response bodies are excluded.
- Approved episodes support private YouTube uploads, TikTok inbox transfers and Instagram Reels. X uses the browser composer. [Accounts and uploads](https://publisher.meruw.dev/guides/uploads/)
- Provider guides and the setup documentation are published on [publisher.meruw.dev](https://publisher.meruw.dev/guides/setup/). The site also serves the privacy policy, terms, optional Meta return page and TikTok verification file.

The seven service and setup guides are maintained in `docs/guides/` and mirrored to the GitHub wiki. See [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the sync command.

## Proof of concept

GitHub Actions runs the Windows build and Go tests with a synthetic bilingual delivery on code changes. Browser fixtures cover playback, account setup, draft recovery, language routing and window controls. Go tests cover credential storage, callback validation and approved-file checks. The Windows build pins Go, Wails and Node; Node compiles the frontend and runs developer checks. The desktop runtime uses WebView2 and the delivery validator needs Python with imageio-ffmpeg.

The PoC is in progress. The project owner decides when it is complete. Release planning starts after that decision.

The owner confirmed native Instagram sign-in and assignment for both ES and EN with access restricted to CATsoup assets. The business login configuration includes `business_management` alongside the Instagram publishing and Page discovery permissions. This confirms account connection, not Reel publishing.

For subsequent release validation, test the packaged validator, media preview and browser sign-in on a clean Windows machine without build tools. Verify ES/EN routing and receipts with operator-owned accounts and approved content, including recovery after an interrupted upload. Supply a versioned artifact, prerequisites and a checksum. No installer or signed release is available.

## Next action

Verify the X handles assigned to ES and EN, then validate language routing and transfer receipts using separately approved content. The production demo remains non-publicable. Check the native console clipboard action after restarting the updated build; automated browser checks use a fixture adapter.
